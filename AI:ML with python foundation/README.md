HACKING: The provided code reads usernames from a passwords.csv file and saves these compromised usernames into a compromised_users.txt file. It then creates a notification message for the boss, indicating mission success, and writes this message into a boss_message.json file. Finally, the code writes a scrambled password art into a new_passwords.csv file.

The A/B testing aims to compare the effectiveness of two different ad versions (A and B) by measuring key metrics such as click-through rates (CTR) and user engagement. By randomly assigning users to either group and analyzing the resulting data, the test determines which ad performs better. The insights gained help optimize future ad campaigns, ensuring that the version yielding higher engagement and conversion rates is implemented. This data-driven approach enhances ad performance and informs strategic decisions to maximize user interaction and conversions.

Sample distribution: The above code demonstrates the concept of sampling distributions by analyzing the distribution of song tempos in the Spotify dataset. It serves to illustrate how sample statistics (mean, minimum, variance) behave when repeatedly sampled from a population, helping to understand the variability and reliability of these statistics. Additionally, it uses the normal distribution to calculate probabilities of observing specific sample means, aiding in statistical inference and decision-making based on sample data.


Linear Algebra: The purpose of the linear algebra in the code is to demonstrate fundamental concepts through image processing tasks. It starts by creating and displaying a simple 7x7 grayscale heart image, then inverts its colors and rotates it by transposing the array. A random 7x7 image is generated, and the heart image is used to set up a linear system of equations 
Ax=B, where 
A is the random image and 
B is the heart image. The solution 
x is found using NumPy's np.linalg.solve, and the heart image is reconstructed by multiplying the random image 
A with the solution matrix x. This process visually and practically reinforces linear algebra concepts such as color inversion, rotation, and solving linear systems.
