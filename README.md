ATM logging: The code simulates basic ATM operations for a BankAccount class, including authentication, deposits, withdrawals, and balance display, using the logging module to record transaction details, statuses, and timestamps

Higher order function: The higher-order functions count and average are designed to provide reusable and composable operations for processing the sales data. These functions allow the script to efficiently count sales records based on specific conditions and calculate averages for numerical fields without explicitly writing iterative loops, making the code more concise, readable, and functional. The sales_analysis.py script processes a CSV file named sales.csv to count the number of sales records from Belgium and calculate the average value of a specific numerical field for sales records from Portugal, providing insights into the sales data for these two countries.

Db-Analysis: The purpose of this database analysis is to help Sleep Away Inc. understand the behavior of their Brazilian customers who canceled their bookings compared to those who did not. By creating a new table bra_customers with data specific to Brazilian customers and analyzing this data, we aim to identify patterns in lead time and evaluate the total number of special requests for both canceled and non-canceled bookings. This analysis provides data-driven insights that can support strategic decisions to improve customer service, reduce cancellation rates, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

Concurrent Programming: The purpose of concurrent programming styles—sequential, asynchronous, threading, and multiprocessing—is to demonstrate various methods of improving performance and efficiency in computational tasks. Sequential programming executes tasks one after the other, which is simple but can be slow. Asynchronous programming uses non-blocking calls to handle I/O-bound tasks efficiently without threading. Threading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, sharing the same memory space, suitable for I/O-bound tasks. Multiprocessing creates separate processes for tasks, providing true parallelism by leveraging multiple CPU cores, ideal for CPU-bound tasks. These approaches help in optimizing the execution time for different types of workloads, depending on their nature and resource requirements.
